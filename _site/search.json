This type of request is often used in preparation for a more in-depth analysis, to determine the rate of new use of a medical product, or the prevalence/incidence of an HOI in the SDD. There are several user options, including defining incidence and additional inclusion/exclusion criteria.\nAn event can be defined using any set of NDCs, procedure and/or diagnosis codes, and laboratory result values found in the SCDM. Procedure and diagnosis codes can be restricted to those observed in specific care settings (e.g., inpatient, outpatient), and diagnosis codes can be restricted by position (e.g., principal discharge diagnosis, secondary diagnosis). For example, exposure to a drug product dispensed in the outpatient setting can be defined as observation of one or more NDCs in the pharmacy dispensing table; occurrence of an HOI can be defined based on observation of specific diagnosis codes in the diagnosis table.\nThe CIDA module queries the SDD and extracts all codes indicative of the event during the query period.

The Combo Tool reduces the need for de novo programming each time a new algorithm is developed as part of a Sentinel workgroup or routine data query.\nThe process of creating single events from combinations of multiple Sentinel Distributed Database (SDD) variables and variable values is simple and flexible. The SAS macro processes multiple “raw” items used to determine a combination and creates a single “virtual” record that summarizes the combination in a fashion identical to raw SDD diagnosis, procedure, or dispensing records. Users of the tool determine how the final virtual record should behave; i.e., if the record should mimic a diagnosis, procedure, or dispensing record, and what date(s) virtual records are assigned.

With these two types of raw items, a total of three types of combinations can be created:\n\nOne Day &lt;-&gt; One Day\nOne Day &lt;-&gt; Multiple Days\nMultiple Days &lt;-&gt; Multiple Days\n\n\n4.3.1 One Day &lt;-&gt; One Day Combinations\nThis type of combination is the most straightforward. To be included in this category, records for the two sets of combination items must occur on the same day. The typical use for this type of combination is to combine diagnoses and procedures. For example, the user may want to identify patients with a depression diagnosis, but without a schizophrenia diagnosis on the same day, or identify patients with a diagnosis for hypertension coupled with a CT scan procedure on the same day. Figure 4.4 illustrates a one day &lt;-&gt; one day combination where the algorithm is identifying single events where X and Y occur on the same day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: One Day - One Day Combinations\n\n\n\nIn this case, there is only one possibility for the virtual record event date, whish is the item X and item Y date (A).\n\n\n4.3.2 One Day &lt;-&gt; Multiple Days Combinations\nTo be included in this category, one of the two combination items must be a single day event. The typical use for this type of combination is to combine diagnoses and procedures with drug use, inpatient stays, or eligibility episodes. For example, the user may want to identify members with liver transplant during a hospital stay or with a diagnosis for arrhythmia during the course of drug treatment. Figure 4.5 illustrates a one day &lt;-&gt; multiple day combination where the algorithm is combining multiple day item X with single date item Y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: One Day - Multiple Day Combinations\n\n\n\nContrary to the same day event category, one day &lt;-&gt; multiple days combinations have up to three choices for start date and end date for the final virtual record (A, B, or C).\n\n\n4.3.3 Multiple Days &lt;-&gt; Multiple Days Combinations\nThis is the last but most general type of combination. To be included in this category, both combination items must span more than one day. The typical use for this type of combination is to combine several drug uses (combination therapy) and/or inpatient stays and/or eligibility spans. For example, the user may want to identify members with a hospital stay with evidence of at least two days of supply for a drug. Figure 4.6 illustrates a multiple day &lt;-&gt; multiple day combination where the algorithm is combining multiple day item X with multiple day item Y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Multiple Days - Multiple Days Combinations\n\n\n\nFor this category, we have up to four choices for start date and end date for the final virtual record (A, B, C, or D).",

The Base record always represents either the first or an intermediate combination item, while the “Combined-to” record always represents a raw item. Each time two combination items are processed, the user must determine which start and end date to retain for the combined record. If the Base + Combined-to combination is an intermediate combination, the dates selected will be carried forward for additional combination processing. If the combination is a final combination, the start and end dates will determine the dates used for the final virtual record. The following start and end date options are available:\n\nThe start date of the Base interval\nThe start date of the Combined-to interval\nThe minimum date between the Base and Combined-to start date\nThe maximum date between the Base and Combined-to start date\nThe end date of the Base interval\nThe end date of the Combined-to interval\nThe minimum date between the Base and Combined-to end date\nThe maximum date between the Base and Combined-to end date\nThe start of the overlapping period between Base and Combined-to interval\nThe end of the overlapping period between Base and Combined-to interval\n\n\n4.4.1 Virtual Record Layout\nOnce dates are specified, the last step is to tell the Combo Tool how the final virtual record summarizing the combination should behave. This is important because the virtual combination record can then be used by any programs designed to query the SDD—i.e., final virtual records can be queried just like any other record in the SDD. Final virtual records can behave like Diagnosis, Procedure, or Dispensing table records in the SDD.",

In this case all cohorts are queried independently and results are reported separately and labeled using each GROUP name specified.\nNote 2: GROUP is the primary key linking cohorts across input files; GROUP values must match (including case) between the TYPE1FILE and other input files.\nNote 3: GROUP value must begin with letter or underscore.\nNote 4: GROUP values must be lowercase.\nFormat: SAS character $40; no special characters (e.g., commas, periods, hyphens, spaces, etc.) allowed, and underscores must be used to mark spaces.\nExample: insulin\n\n\nAllowed Number of Index Dates per Individual\nT1COHORTDEF\nIndicates how many index dates an individual can contribute. Options include:\n\n01: Cohort includes only the first valid index date per individual during the query period.\n02: Cohort includes all valid index dates per individual during the query period.\n\nNote 1: T1COHORTDEF parameter is used in conjunction with the T1WASHPER variable (below) to define valid index date(s).\n\nFormat: SAS character $2\nExample: 01\n\n\nType 1 Index Washout Period\nT1WASHPER\nLength of washout period in days. The washout period is a period before an index date during which an individual cannot have evidence of index-defining criteria (see Cohort Codes File specification for additional details on index-defining criteria).\nNote 1 special case: when T1WASHPER = missing the program requires ENRDAYS of continuous enrollment but only considers an exposure/event valid if, at index date, the member has no evidence of the exposure in their entire available enrollment history that meets coverage requirements (as specified in COVERAGE)\nFormat: Numeric\nExample: 365\n\n\nCensor Enrollment at Evidence of Death\nCENSOR_DTH\nIndicates if enrollment should be censored based on death date. Allowable values are Y and N.\nDate of death can be determined two ways:\n\nWhere Discharge_Status = EX in the SCDM Encounter table, date of death is set to discharge date.\nUsing death date in the SCDM Death table for records where Confidence = E.\n\nNote 1: in cases where a death date appears in both the Death and Encounter tables, the date from the Death table will be used.\n\nNote 2: censoring is implemented by restricting enrollment eligibility. Member eligibility is truncated at death date. Once a death date is observed, a member can no longer contribute eligible periods (even if they are observed in the data).\n\nFormat: SAS character $1\nExample: Y\n\n\nCategories for Follow-up Time\nCENSOR_OUTPUT_CAT\nIndicates ranges (in days) for stratification variable CENSDAYS_VALUE in [RUNID]_censor_cida.sas7bdat output.\nNote 1: leave blank if only continuous values of CENSDAYS_VALUE are desired. If this field is left blank, output stratified by CENSDAYS_VALUE in [RUNID]_censor_cida will have one category that includes all values of CENSDAYS_VALUE.\nNote 2: For each cohort in the TYPE1FILE, CENSOR_OUTPUT_CAT must specify the same value.\nFormat: SAS character—length can vary\nExample: 0-364 365-729 730-1094 1095+\n\n\nOutput Denominator Indicator\nOUTPUTDENOM\nIndicates whether to calculate denominator variables DENNUMPTS (number of patients eligible to have at least one index date) and DENNUMMEMDAYS (number of days that patients are eligible to have an index date).\nValid values are:\n\nY: DENNUMPTS and DENNUMMEMDAYS variables will be calculated and populated in [RUNID]_t1_cida.sas7bdat.\nM: DENNUMPTS variable will be calculated and populated in [RUNID]_t1_cida.sas7bdat. DENNUNMEMDAYS variable will NOT be calculated and will be set to missing in [RUNID]_t1_cida.sas7bdat.\nN: DENNUMPTS and DENNUMMEMDAYS variables will NOT be calculated and will be set to missing in [RUNID]_t1_cida.sas7bdat.\n\nNote 1: if MINRXDAYS is specified as an inclusion/exclusion criterion, OUTPUTDENOM will be automatically set to N.\n\nNote 2: When performing a Type 1 or 2 analysis that calculates denominators (e.g., eligible members and eligible member-days) and requesting stratifications, the CIDA module will only populate denominators for the pre-defined stratification variables (see Table 2 in the User-defined Strata Levels Lookup Table documentation).\n\nFormat: SAS character $1\nExample: Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo read more about how Type 1 Queries work, please refer to Type 1: Extract Information to Calculate Background Rates.
